Content moderation is critical to major global social media platforms such as Facebook
and Twitter. However, it faces challenges in eVectively handling cultural diVerences. For
instance, content moderators may need help interpreting specific languages, such as
Maori or New Zealand slang, leading to inaccurate assessments. To address this issue, we
suggest a computer-aided approach that provides moderators with supplementary
information on these culturally specific terms.
