phrase,definition
Bach," this is definitely a good one to know. A bach is a summer house. Lots of Kiwis have one and they are popular in beach resorts. They tend to be pretty basic (although they are getting more up-market). If you are looking for cheap accommodation in New Zealand, check out bookabach.co.nz where you can rent out these holiday homes"
Beaut, used to describe something that is really good. Simple as.
Bro," ah, an absolute Kiwi staple. Bro is short for brother and is used to describe your best mates (as well as your actual brother). Probably one of the most used Kiwi slang terms and one of our favourites."
Chips," rather like the Americans, we use the word ‘chips’ to describe what the Brits call ‘crisps’, hence why we need to call number 14 ‘hot chips’. To be fair, those Brits do make a good point to avoid confusion but that’s the way we’ve always done it and we’re sticking with it!"
Chocka, full to the top.
Crook, this is one of our favourites and is used if you’re not feeling too well.
Cuz(zie), another Kiwi favourite. Cuz or cuzzie is short for cousin and is used in a similar way to bro or as an alternative. Can be used to describe males and females.
Dairy," this is a traditional corner shop and sells everyday essentials including milk, newspapers and those all essential Lotto tickets!"
Eftpos," this is short for Electronic Fund Transaction at Point of Sale and is the way Kiwis pay for everything. Used to describe both the cash machine and the card swipe in dairies, restaurants, shops  everywhere really. You will be faced with 3 options when using an Eftpos  cheque, savings and credit  if in doubt go with cheque!"
Eh," Probably the most used of all Kiwi slang terms. If you spend any serious amount of time here, it won’t be long before this becomes part of your daily vocab. Used to confirm that something you are saying is true, without really asking a question. It’s pronounced ‘ayy’"
Feijoa, this is not really slang but it is a good one to know. A feijoa is a fruit that is native to New Zealand and doesn’t seem to be found anywhere else. They take a bit of getting used to but don’t disrespect them as Kiwis are very protective of them!
Heaps, used to describe ‘lots’ of something. It’s another well-used Kiwi slang term which you could say we use ‘heaps’!
Hokey pokey," surely one of the best things about New Zealand. Hokey pokey is a flavour which is very similar to honeycomb. It can be ice cream, a chocolate bar or other lollies. It is truly delicious so make sure you remember this one!"
Hot chips, perhaps one of the most confusing things for visitors is the way we describe our potato-based snacks. Hot chips literally refer to hot cooked chips. Most foreigners (especially the Brits) get super confused and wonder why we need to call them ‘hot’ chips!
Jandals," whether you call them flip flops or thongs where you come from, the perennial summer footwear favourite is called a jandal in NZ. They are one step up from going bare foot (which Kiwis do a lot!) and often look pretty battered!"
Lolly," whilst many countries use the word ‘lolly’ to describe a sweet that’s on a stick, New Zealanders use it to describe all sweets!"
Munted, this one has two meanings which equate to the same thing! Used to describe something that is broken (pretty much beyond repair) or used to describe someone who is really drunk (pretty much beyond repair!)
No worries," similar to sweet as, no worries is the best way to describe Kiwis in general  they’ve got no worries! Kiwis are super laid back so you will hear this one a lot!"
OE, literally short for Overseas Experience. Most Kiwis will take an OE when they graduate from Uni or before they get their first job. It usually involves a 6 month trip to Europe starting off in the UK.
Scroggin," if you’re heading out on a big tramp, you might want to pack yourself a bag of scroggin  a mix of nuts and fruit which is often called trail mix in other countries."
Scull," this one is a favourite of the university crowd and means to down your drink. If someone yells it at you, it’s best just to do it!"
She’ll be right, when something is not working perfectly but it will be all good in the end.
Stoked, super happy about something.
Sweet as, used to describe something that is awesome but also used when there’s no problem. This one is a Kiwi classic slang term and has been taken on all over the world.
Tiki tour," this one is a confusing one for overseas visitors. A tiki tour is a small organised tour where you will see a lot of things in a day. Alternatively, if you head the long way to a place or someone’s house, you might get called out for taking a tiki tour."
Togs, describes your swimming gear and is used by boys and girls.
Tramp," whilst some people may use the term to describe homeless people, it has a completely different meaning here in NZ and refers to going out for a long walk or hike."
Wop Wops, this is a term used to describe the middle of nowhere. New Zealand has some pretty remote towns and villages so this is used a lot.
Yeah…nah," we’re still not really sure if this means yes or no! If you want to be super vague about something, this is the perfect way to answer."
Good as gold,don’t know how we missed this the first time around as it’s such an endearing term. Good as gold basically means you are very happy with what someone has just said or told you.
Yonks, used to describe a long period of time.
You’re such an egg, this basically means you are a bit of a clown or a joker.
Snag, Another word for sausage. A barbecue is a standard way of socialising in New Zealand so this is definitely one of the most popular kiwi slang terms of the summer.
Far out, This is an interjection that can mean ‘wow’ or ‘awesome’ and can be used in both a positive and negative light
